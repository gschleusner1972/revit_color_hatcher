# revit_color_hatcher

A Revit Addin colorize Revit models via applying a solid hatch with colors to views.

It was origonaly developed to aide in Photoshop/ Affinity based workflows where select by color, type etc was hard.  

I think its Revit 2022, but could be 2021

It would like to be developed furuther to use consistant colors and create masks for AI training task.
